name: Child Page

This is content for the child page. Click "Home" in the breadcrumbs to experience the issue. You will be redirected to `/demo/main` and recieve a 404 instead of going to `/main`.

This problem also occurs for any other links like [ones pointing to the site root `/`](/) or [to an aliased name at the site root like `/index`](/index) which send the visitor to the alias redirect.
